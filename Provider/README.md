ðŸ”¹ Key Points (Interview-ready)

Providers are plugins that let Terraform talk to APIs.

They define what resources (create/update/delete infra) and data sources (read-only info) you can use.

Managed by Terraform Registry (https://registry.terraform.io).

Declared in required_providers block.

Can configure multiple providers or multiple instances of the same provider (with aliases).

âœ… In short:
A provider is like a bridge between Terraform and a service (AWS, Azure, Kubernetes, etc.), enabling Terraform to manage infrastructure on that service.
