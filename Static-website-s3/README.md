# Create Static Website using Terraform
## Implementation Plan

1. Create an S3 bucket.

2. Configure the S3 bucket for public access (so the bucket and its objects can be accessed publicly).

3. Enable static website hosting on the S3 bucket.

4. Upload index.html and error.html files to the bucket.

5. Access the website using the S3 website endpoint
