# Map

## What is a Map in Terraform?

A map is a collection of key-value pairs â€” similar to a dictionary in Python or an object in JSON.

You use a map when you want to store multiple related values that can be accessed by a key.

## When to Use a Map

Use map when:

You want to group related data (like tags, configurations, or region-specific settings).

You want to access values dynamically using keys.
