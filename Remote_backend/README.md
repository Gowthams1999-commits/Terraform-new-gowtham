# Terraform State File and Remote Backend

Terraform uses a state file (terraform.tfstate) to track infrastructure.
By default, this file is stored locally, but best practice is to store it in a remote backend like AWS S3.

ðŸ”¹ Remote Backend with S3 and DynamoDB

S3 bucket â†’ stores the Terraform state file.

DynamoDB table â†’ provides state locking (to avoid race conditions when multiple people run Terraform).

Example backend config:

terraform {
  backend "s3" {
    bucket         = "my-terraform-state"
    key            = "prod/terraform.tfstate"
    region         = "us-east-1"
    dynamodb_table = "terraform-locks"
  }
}

ðŸ”¹ Terraform v1.10.X Update (State Locking)

In Terraform 1.10.X, you can avoid using DynamoDB for state locking by enabling lockfiles:

terraform {
  backend "s3" {
    bucket       = "my-terraform-state"
    key          = "prod/terraform.tfstate"
    region       = "us-east-1"
    use_lockfile = true
  }
}


This creates a .tflock file inside the S3 bucket for state locking instead of requiring DynamoDB.

ðŸ”¹ Difference Between -migrate-state and -reconfigure
1. terraform init -migrate-state

ðŸ‘‰ Purpose: Moves your existing state from the old backend to the new backend.

Example:

# Initially state is local (terraform.tfstate file)
terraform init -migrate-state


Terraform will upload your local state into the new backend (e.g., S3).
This way, you donâ€™t lose your infrastructure state.

âœ… Use when:

Moving from local â†’ remote backend

Moving from one remote backend â†’ another

2. terraform init -reconfigure

ðŸ‘‰ Purpose: Forget old backend settings and use the new ones, but donâ€™t move state automatically.

Example:

# Old backend
backend "s3" {
  bucket = "my-terraform-state"
  key    = "prod/terraform.tfstate"
  region = "us-east-1"
}

# New backend
backend "s3" {
  bucket = "new-terraform-state"
  key    = "prod/terraform.tfstate"
  region = "us-east-1"
}

terraform init -reconfigure


Terraform will reinitialize the backend with the new config.
If you need the old state, you must move/copy it manually.

âœ… Use when:

Backend configuration changed (new bucket, region, or credentials)

You want to reset backend settings without migrating state

âš¡ Summary

-migrate-state â†’ Moves state to new backend

-reconfigure â†’ Resets backend config, no state migration
