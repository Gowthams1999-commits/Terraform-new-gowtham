# Validation block and Condition

📘 Validation Block and Condition in Terraform

Terraform allows you to control what values are allowed inside variables.
This is done using:

Validation Block → To restrict variable values

Conditional Operator → To choose between two values based on a condition

Both are essential for building safe and predictable Terraform code.

✅ 1. Validation Block in Terraform

A validation block is used inside a variable definition to ensure the user provides valid input.

📌 Purpose

Prevent invalid values

Display custom error messages

Enforce strict input rules

✅ 2. Conditional Operator in Terraform

Terraform supports ternary conditional expressions, similar to many programming languages.

condition ? true_value : false_value
